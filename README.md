# Telegram Tools Repository

Due to the successful growth of Telegram in the social network space, its support for all countries, and other significant benefits, I cannot overlook utilizing it in my projects. This repository consists of four distinct tools designed to enhance interaction and functionality within Telegram:

1. **Auto-Response Assistant**: Automatically send predefined messages in response to specific incoming messages, simulating an intelligent assistant.
2. **Chat and User Scraper**: Scrape chats and user information from Telegram channels for data collection and analysis.
3. **LLM-Powered Auto-Responder**: Utilize a large language model (LLM) API to automatically respond to users and engage in AI-driven conversations.
4. **VPN Sales Bot**: A Telegram bot that allows users to browse, select, and purchase VPN services via the Marzban API.
